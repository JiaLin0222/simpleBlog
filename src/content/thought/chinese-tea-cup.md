The Chinese tea cup, with its simple design lacking a handle, is a masterclass in user experience. It forces us to slow down and appreciate the tea's temperature before drinking. 

### Why it Works

- No handle = Hot tea = Wait to drink (avoids burns)
- Skips unnecessary features (handles, sleeves)
- Focuses on pure function and elegant design

### A Lesson in Simplicity

The tea cup reminds us that sometimes, the most effective solutions are the simplest. It encourages us to embrace limitations and find beauty in uncluttered design.
