Today I learned about the brilliant simplicity of the Chinese tea cup:
You know, I can't get over how brilliant the design of the Chinese tea cup is. It's such an elegant solution, really makes you appreciate the wisdom behind it.

Think about it - no handles, right? At first you're like "Wait, how am I supposed to pick this up?" But then it hits you - if it's too hot to hold directly, then the tea inside is way too hot to drink anyway! Such a simple concept, but it just clicks.
We always want to complicate things and add more layers, don't we? A sleeve, a warning label, sure let's slap a handle on there too! But none of that changes the fundamental issue. You'll still scald your mouth if you drink too soon after steeping.

It's not that we're oblivious to the warnings. We just instinctively build up more barriers between us and the obvious answer staring us in the face. The tea cup strips all that away and lays bare the elegant truth.


That's the true genius of it! Simplifying until the solution is undeniable. No distractions, no gimmicks, just letting the pure function shine through. Makes you appreciate the beauty in such a humble, ancient design. Definitely gives me a new admiration for the creativity of constraints.
