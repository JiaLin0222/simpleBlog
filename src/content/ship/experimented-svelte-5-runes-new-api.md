# Experimented Svelte 5's Runes new API

I've been following the development of Svelte 5 and I'm excited to see the new API for creating components. I decided to create a simple todo app with the new Runes API to see how it works.

Here's quick overview of the new API:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Svelte 5&#39;s Runes APIs are more thoughtful in their design ðŸ¤ŒðŸ§¡ <a href="https://t.co/jM8b3NK9hW">pic.twitter.com/jM8b3NK9hW</a></p>&mdash; Sanju (@spikeysanju) <a href="https://twitter.com/spikeysanju/status/1789098507170906367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I'm impressed with how thoughtfull the new API is. It's easier to create/manage states easily. Initially, I was skeptical about the new API, but after using it, I can see the benefits. The new API is more intuitive and makes it easier to write clean and maintainable code.

I'm looking forward to using the new API in [SticAi](https://sticai.com) and [Uiino](https://uiino.com) to improve the performance and maintainability of the codebase.

That's all for now. I'll be sharing more updates soon. Stay tuned!
