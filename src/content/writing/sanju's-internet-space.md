## about project
this is a simple personal website i built using [astro](https://astro.build/), a static site generator. i chose Astro for its speed, flexibility, and ease of use. i hope you like the site!

## features
- **writings**: a collection of my blog posts and articles
- **thoughts**: a place for me to share my random thoughts and ideas (more like tweets or quotes)
- **ships**: a list of projects that i've worked on or contributed to (github style commit graph will be generated based on the things i've worked on)

## tech stack
- **astro**: static site generator
- **tailwindcss**: utility-first css framework for rapid prototyping
- **markdown**: for writing content in a simple and easy-to-read format
- **typescript**: for type-checking and better code quality 
- **biome**: Format, lint, and more in a fraction of a second.
- **cloudflare pages**: for hosting the site and continuous deployment

## design
- i wanted to keep the design simple and clean. i used a monochrome color scheme with a pop of color for the accent. 
- i also used a lot of whitespace to make the content easy to read and navigate. 
- i'm a big fan of minimalism and KISS (keep it simple, stupid) and i think it works well for a personal website like this. 
- i hope you like the design as much as i do!
