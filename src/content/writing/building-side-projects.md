## Building side projects changed my life. here's how:

I'm a builder. Always have been. Started at 18. Self-taught dev. Learn by doing.

First, iOS. No iPhone though. Switched to Android.

Found MIT App Inventor. Drag-and-drop stuff. Got bored. Moved to Android Studio.

No mentor. Skipped class. Stayed late. 21km commute home.

Loved every minute.

Watched tutorials. Tried new things. Tweaked code. Made it work.

Got good at coding. Design sucked though. So I learned that too.

Already knew art. Painting, sketching. Helped a bit.

Copied Dribbble designs. Daily practice. Got decent after a few months.

Joined open source. Learned tons from bright minds.

Started YouTube. Reduced my inferiority complex. Made mistakes. Got traction.

Founded a [dev community](https://github.com/TheCodeMonks). The Code Monks. Learned from others' experiences.

Got design jobs. Improved products from scratch.

Worked at companies. Gained experience. Got bored. Quit.

Started my own [ThisUX â€“ Design Led Product studio](https://thisux.com). Tough at first. Got better.

Became full-stack. Tried all frameworks. Fell in love with [Svelte/Kit](svelte.dev).

Built client products. Made my own too. Always top-notch design.

Still build side projects. For fun. Keeps me curious.

It's not wasting time. It's connecting dots.

You become what you consume. I believe that.

Building keeps me proactive. Gets things done.

Won't stop. Build. Share. Do it forever.

That's the power of building. It's not just about the product. It's about you.

Few things I've learned:
- **Start small.** Don't overthink. Just start.
- **Learn by doing.** Tutorials are good. But build something.
- **Stay curious.** Always try new things.
- **Share your work.** Get feedback. Improve.
- **Don't stop.** Keep building. Keep growing.
- **Have fun.** It's your playground. Enjoy it.
- **Connect the dots.** Everything you learn is useful.
- **Stay ahead.** Keep learning. Stay updated.
- **Build for yourself.** Scratch your own itch.
- **Don't give up.** It's hard. But worth it.
- **Build with love.** It shows in your work.
- **Build for others.** Make their lives better.
- **Build for the future.** Innovate. Stay ahead.


Find your playground. Build. Learn. Grow. Innovate. Stay ahead.
