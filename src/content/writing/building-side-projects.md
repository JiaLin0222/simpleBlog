## Building side projects changed my life. here's how:

I'm a builder. Always have been. Started at 18. Self-taught dev. Learn by doing.

First, iOS. No iPhone though. Switched to Android.

Found MIT App Inventor. Drag-and-drop stuff. Got bored. Moved to Android Studio.

No mentor. Skipped class. Stayed late. 21km commute home.

Loved every minute.

Watched tutorials. Tried new things. Tweaked code. Made it work.

Got good at coding. Design sucked though. So I learned that too.

Already knew art. Painting, sketching. Helped a bit.

Copied Dribbble designs. Daily practice. Got decent after a few months.

Worked for others. Gained experience. Started my own thing.

Still build side projects. For fun. Keeps me sharp.

It's addictive. In a good way. Always learning. Always improving.

Side projects aren't just hobbies. They're my lab. My playground. My school.

They keep me ahead. In tech. In business. In life.

That's the power of building. It's not just about the product. It's about you.
