I run [ThisUX](https://thisux.com), a design-led product studio. We make things that work.

For years, I wore many hats. Now I'm doing my own thing.

I'm working on ideas like:

- [Uiino](https://uiino.com) 
- [SticAi](https://sticai.com) 
- [aboGrow](https://abogrow.com) 
- [ffmpeg info](https://ffmpeg.info)
- [Glance](https://glance.sticai.com)
- [Spotlight](https://spotlight.thisux.com)
- [Supaprompts](https://supaprompts.com)


And more. Always tinkering.

I team up with founders and business owners. We build MVPs, full products, or fix broken experiences. Design to code, we do it all.

Our secret? We create systems that work, no matter the tech or problem.

I'm big on [open source](https://github.com/spikeysanju) too. I contribute code and speak at conferences.
