# sanju's â€“ personal space on the internet
hey all, welcome to my personal space on the internet. this is where i share my thoughts, ideas, and projects. feel free to look around and reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat. i'm always open to meeting new people and learning new things. thanks for stopping by! 

## about project
this project is a simple personal website that i built using [astro](https://astro.build/). it's a static site generator that allows you to build modern websites with the power of react. i chose astro because it's fast, flexible, and easy to use. i also wanted to learn more about static site generators and how they work. i'm really happy with how the site turned out and i hope you like it too!

## features
- **writings**: a collection of my blog posts and articles
- **thoughts**: a place for me to share my random thoughts and ideas (more like tweets or quotes)
- **ships**: a list of projects that i've worked on or contributed to (github style commit graph will be generated based on the things i've worked on)

## tech stack
- **astro**: static site generator
- **tailwindcss**: utility-first css framework for rapid prototyping
- **markdown**: for writing content in a simple and easy-to-read format
- **typescript**: for type-checking and better code quality 
- **biome**: Format, lint, and more in a fraction of a second.
- **cloudflare pages**: for hosting the site and continuous deployment

## design
i wanted to keep the design simple and clean. i used a monochrome color scheme with a pop of color for the accent. i also used a lot of whitespace to make the content easy to read and navigate. i'm a big fan of minimalism and KISS (keep it simple, stupid) and i think it works well for a personal website like this. i hope you like the design as much as i do!

## contributing
if you have any ideas or suggestions for the site, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. i'm always open to feedback and i'd love to hear your thoughts on how i can improve the site. i'm also open to collaborations and contributions, so if you have an idea for a feature or project you'd like to work on together, let me know!
